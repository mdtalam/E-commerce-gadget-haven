## List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project

Hereâ€™s a list of fundamental React concepts that are commonly used in projects:

1. JSX (JavaScript XML): A syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML, making it easier to structure UI components in code.

2. Components: The building blocks of React applications. Components can be either functional (using functions) or class-based (using ES6 classes). Components make it possible to reuse UI parts and encapsulate functionality.

3. Props (Properties): Props allow you to pass data from one component to another, especially from parent to child components. They are read-only, making components predictable and easy to debug.

4. State: A component's state holds dynamic data that affects what is rendered on the screen. State is local to a component but can be passed down as props if needed in child components.
5. Hooks (in functional components): useState, useEffect, useContext, and more.

6. Event Handling: Handling user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and other events directly within components using inline functions or methods.

7. Conditional Rendering: Rendering components or elements conditionally using JavaScript expressions like if statements, ternary operators, and logical && operators within JSX.

8. Lists and Keys: Rendering lists of elements using JavaScriptâ€™s array methods (like map) and assigning a unique key to each item to optimize performance.

9. Forms and Controlled Components: Handling form inputs by making them controlled components, where the React state is the single source of truth for form inputs.

10. React Router (for Navigation): Handling routing in a single-page application (SPA) by using react-router library to manage URL paths, parameters, and navigation.

11. useEffect Hook: Managing side effects in functional components. Itâ€™s commonly used for data fetching, setting up subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulations.

12. Prop Types and Type Checking: Using PropTypes to enforce type-checking on props to ensure that components receive correct prop types.

13. Error Boundaries: Special components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, logging them and displaying a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app.
